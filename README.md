Hotel Reservation Smart Contract
--------------------------------

In this mini-project, I build a simple smart contract for hotel reservation.
A person can book a hotel room for a certain duration of time through this smart contract. 
The payment for this booking is using HTK (Hotel Token).
The main requirement before they can book a room is they must have got vaccinated first. 
After the requirement passed and they complete the payment, then the reservation is successful and the booking code is issued.
